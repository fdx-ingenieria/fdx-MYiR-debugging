## AP issue
We can get the AP running and working, we've been using it for testing and it works just fine at first. But at some point, some driver related errors appear in the kernel log 
(The ones that are in the .txt file), after that the AP falls, and the only way we could get it working again is by removing and inserting again the driver from the kernel itself.
